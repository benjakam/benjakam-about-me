<br>
<br>
I've been a freelancer since 2016 and I've been learning web development since 2020.

In the past few years I had some experiences with:

- Online customer support
- Project management
- Web design jobs
- Experience with Photoshop & Figma
- Create and maintain Wordpress websites and themes
- Front-end development
- HTML - CSS - (SASS)
- some javascript side jobs for smaller projects
- Online teamwork
- Experience with Git version control

I like to learn new things, everyday. I really enjoy discovering and understanding other programming languages.
Here on Github I would like to realize and publish my own projects. It's also exciting to support other projects and I'm happy to help and learn from other programmers.
